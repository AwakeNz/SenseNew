	One of the Clan members can be selected and be delegated the role of Clan Leader.<br1>
	If you request delegation of Clan Leader, it is usually completed every Tuesday. However, sometimes the delegation process can be completed sooner then that.<br1>
	Please consider your decision carefully before making the request.<br1>
	Once the delegation process is completed it cannot be canceled. However, it is possible to cancel it if process has been not completed.<br1>
	I'll say this once more. Since the delegation of a Clan Lord is the process in which all the rights of a Clan Leader are transferred to another Clan member, you need to consider your decision very carefully before submitting your request.<br1>
